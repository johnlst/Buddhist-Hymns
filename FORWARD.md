Buddhist hymns, until very recently, were composed by American Buddhist many years back and, since then, little was done to increase the collection. The few hymns made available to us were sung until they were depleted of a life force necessary for sustaining interest. Howevewr, two years ago when this temple became the fountainhead for new hymns, there was a revival of interest in hymns especially among the youth groups and Sunday Schools, not only in Kuala Lumpur but also throughout the country.

The reason for this enthusiam was not hard to find as Buddhist hymns, which emboy the expression of joy in the Triple Gem and Buddhist aspiration and way of life, facilitate fellowship spirit by urging everyone to contribute his share so that each may jointly help to weave a tapestry of harmonious sounds. They are also social lubricant: those who participate whole heartedly in singing would usually extend this fellowship in their group meetings and discussions.

Resulting from the demand for more hymns, we felt that the first hymn book, _Buddhist Hymns and Devotions_, were no longer adequate. In this book we have included English and Malay hymns and Pali gathas, and also attempted to provide the quitar chords, the lyric writer and the composer to as many of the songs as possible. Also contained in this book are poems which are not yet set to music but we are confident that the music will come eventually.

My heartfelt thanks go to Wendy Choong for the design of the cover, Janis Khong for typing the first draft, Chan Boon Seng, Mr. Hew Kim Chai and Mdm. Tan Mun Lee for the book in its final form. Above all, I would like to express my appreciation to Ven. K. Sri Dhammananda Maha Nayaka Thera for his invaluable advice and to the Buddhist Missionary Society for Publishing this book.
