{comment: Verse 1}
In [A]uni[E]ty we [A]stand,
In [E]harmo[A]ny [G#dim]we [F#m]strive,
The [Bm]Cause shall [D]never [A]end, 
As [C#]long as [F#m]we're [B7]a[E]live.
We're one, [A]we're [E]one.
Always, [A]al[E]ways.
We're [A]one always.
One [D]Cause, one [F#m]Cause en[G#]fol[A]ding us
A[Bm]long [E]Dhamma's [A]Way.

{comment: Verse 2}
One cosmic brotherhood,
One purpose moulding us,
Bringing us all to good,
Kindling the Light in us.
Strive on, strive on,
Heedfully, heedfully.
Strive on heedfully.
Along, along the Eightfold Way
To Nirvana's Day.
